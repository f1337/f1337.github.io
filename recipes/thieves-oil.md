# Homemade/DIY Thieves' Oil


Combine in a 30mL bottle:

    40 drops Cinnamon Leaf Essential Oil (bark oil is toxic)
    60 drops Clove Bud Essential Oil (read the precautions!)
    60 drops “Lemon Eucalyptus” (Eucalyptus Citriodora) Essential Oil or Eucalyptus Radiata Essential Oil (avoid eucalyptus globulus)
    80 drops Lemon Essential Oil
    40 drops Rosemary Essential Oil
    20 drops Sage Essential Oil
    40 drops Ravensara Essential Oil
    (optional) 40-60 drops of any aromatic essential oil of your choosing. We have found Lavender Essential Oil to be effective at balancing the clove + citrus scent of the other oils.

…then fill the bottle with a light carrier oil of your choosing
