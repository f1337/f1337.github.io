My name is Michael Fleet. I'm a software polyglot, hardware tinkerer, and musician. I love working with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Go, HTTP-APIs, Docker, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.

Things that I have written which may interest you:

- [Thought Larder](thought-larder/README.md): Techniques & processes for software development, which I have collected during my 20+ years working in the craft.
- [Music](music/README): I made some albums while in an indie rock band during the 1990s. More recently I've been making music with Sonic Pi.
- Perhaps even my [scratchpad of less organized thoughts](zzz/README.md).
