My name is Michael Fleet. I'm a software polyglot and hardware tinkerer, who loves working with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Go, HTTP-APIs, Docker, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.

- Notes on [architectural decision records](tradecraft/architectural-decision-records.md) and [when to use them](tradecraft/flowchart.md).

- My [twitter](https://twitter.com/mrf1337) is an un-curated mix of infosec, mental health, mysticism, and christian leftist politics. i am as often full of ðŸ’© on there as not. i auto-delete tweets after a year. YMMV, and your opinion of me may never be the same. caveat emptor.
