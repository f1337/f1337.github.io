# 👋 hello, whirrled

My name is Michael Fleet. I'm a software polyglot and hardware tinkerer, who loves working with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Go, HTTP-APIs, Docker, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.

- notes on [architectural decision records](scratchpad/adrs.md) and [when to use them](scratchpad/flowchart.md)
- and maybe some of my [less organized thoughts](scratchpad/README.md).
