My name is Michael Fleet. I'm a software polyglot, hardware tinkerer, and musician. I love working with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Go, HTTP-APIs, Docker, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.

Things that I have written which may interest you:

- [Tradecraft](tradecraft/README.md): Techniques & processes for software development.
- [Music](https://github.com/f1337/music): Music created with Sonic Pi.
- â€¦and maybe some of my [less organized thoughts](scratchpad/README.md).
- Credentials: [resume/CV](cv/), [patents](cv/#patents), [github](https://github.com/f1337), [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/f1337).
- My [twitter](https://twitter.com/mrf1337) is an un-curated mix of software, infosec, mental health, mysticism, and christian leftist politics. I am as often full of ðŸ’© on there as not. I mean well, but don't always do as well as I'd like. I auto-delete tweets after a year. YMMV, and your opinion of me may never be the same. Caveat emptor.
