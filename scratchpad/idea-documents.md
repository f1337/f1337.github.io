# Idea Documents

## What are they?

A short template to facilitate structured decision-making .

## Who may write an Idea Document?

Anyone! Idea Documents are intended to be used by everyone, including product managers, engineers, designers, end-users, writersâ€¦literally any member of the organization may write one.

## When might we write an Idea Document?

Any time we have an idea for a feature/improvement/bugfix/whatever which requires research, may impact others on our team, or impact other teams, or if we just want feedback.

If you find yourself wondering whether to you should write an RFC, and Idea Document is an excellent low-commitment first step, and its format naturally evolves into an RFC (if needed).

## Why would we write an idea document?

- To solicit solutions and other feedback early in the problem-solving process.
- To communicate impact/importance to other teams/teammates.
- To give structure to our thoughts as we ideate.
