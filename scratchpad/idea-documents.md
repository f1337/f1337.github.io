# Idea Documents

## What are they?

A short structured format, designed to help facilitate group/team problem-solving.

## Who may write an Idea Document?

Anyone! Idea Documents are intended to be used by everyone, including product managers, engineers, designers, end-users, writersâ€¦literally any member of the organization may write one.

## When might we write an Idea Document?

Any time we have an idea for a feature/improvement/bugfix/whatever which requires research, may impact others on our team, or impact other teams, or if we just want feedback.

If you find yourself wondering if you should write an RFC, an Idea Document is lower-effort, and its format naturally evolves into an RFC (if needed/desired).

## Why would we write an idea document?

- To solicit solutions and other feedback early in the problem-solving process.
- To communicate impact/importance to other teams/teammates.
- To give structure to our thoughts as we ideate.

## How to write an Idea Document?

This is a good template: https://josiahhester.com/cpsc462_682/deliverable1_example1.pdf

We will create a GitHub and/or Confluence template from the above, soon.

## Where do we publish Idea Documents? Where do I find them?

TBD.
