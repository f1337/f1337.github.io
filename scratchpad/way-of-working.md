# My "Way of Working"
_aka my post-ceremonial-agile processes_

- **All** work is shown on the board.
- Daily huddles are re-planning meetings, not status meetings.
- Prioritization, not estimation.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines.
- Record *all* decisions (using [ADRs](adrs.md), etc.)
- Iterative product evolution: :ice_skate: :arrow_right: :kick_scooter: :arrow_right: :bike: :arrow_right: :motorcycle: :arrow_right: :car:
