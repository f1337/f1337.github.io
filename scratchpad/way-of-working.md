# My "Way of Working"
_aka my post-ceremonial-agile processes_

## Board practices

- **All** work is be visualized on the board. There is no such thing as work "outside the scope of the iteration/project/team".
- Columns reflect the workflow.
	- [Todo/Doing/Done is not your process](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-2.html).
	- [Blocked is not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices.html).
	- [Done is not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-3.html).
- Work the board from right to left.
- [Use WIP limits](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-5.html).
- [Use colors, wisely](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-4.html).

## Daily re-planning

## Planning cadence

- Daily huddles are re-planning meetings, not status meetings.
- Prioritization, not estimation.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines.
- Record *all* decisions (using [ADRs](adrs.md), etc.)
- Iterative product evolution: :ice_skate: :arrow_right: :kick_scooter: :arrow_right: :bike: :arrow_right: :motorcycle: :arrow_right: :car:
- Team Leads have 1:1s biweekly with teammates  
- Team Leads lead a weekly team meeting, with engineers and Product Managers as stakeholders (PMs lead when TL is out)  
- Product Managers lead daily replanning meetings, TLs as backup  
- formal product planning happens monthly  
- ad-hoc product replanning is welcome, but must be documented and reviewed at next formal planning meeting  
- all decisions are documented in a single, searchable location
