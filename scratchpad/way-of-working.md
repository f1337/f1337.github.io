# My "Way of Working"
_aka the post-ceremonial-agile processes that work best for me, synthesized from the ideas of many who have gone before me_

## Board practices

- **All** work is be visualized on the board. There is no such thing as work "outside the scope of the iteration/project/team".
- [Todo/Doing/Done is not your process](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-2.html). The columns on the board should reflect your _actual_ workflow. One way to find your process is to work backwards from "done", asking _"[What happens before that?](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-2.html#how-to-do-this)"_.
- _Blocked_ should be a label, [not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices.html).
- [Done is not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-3.html), because we aren't actually "done". What are our post-launch processes? Co _Monitor in Production_, _Post Release Feedback_,
- [Use WIP limits](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-5.html).
- [Use colors, wisely](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-4.html).

## Daily re-planning huddles

- Daily huddles are re-planning meetings, not status meetings.
- Led by Team Leads or Product Managers.
- [Work the board from right to left](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/03/comments-on-board-practices-7.html). What work we can ship today?
- [Focus on the work, not the workers](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-6.html).
- Ad-hoc product re-planning is welcome, but should be documented and reviewed at next formal planning meeting. Record and publish *all* changes for stakeholder review.

## Product/iteration planning meetings

- Monthly formal product/iteration planning, to adjust priorities and workstreams. This is where big goalpost moves can happen.
- Review past month's decisions from re-planning meetings (if any).
- Prioritization, not estimation. The best estimates are still only bets.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines. How much time are we willing to spend/risk?
- Record *all* decisions.
- Iterative product evolution :ice_skate: :arrow_right: :kick_scooter: :arrow_right: :bike: :arrow_right: :motorcycle: :arrow_right: :car:

## Retros

[Turn up the good](turn-up-the-good.md).

## Et cetera 

- Team Leads have 1:1s with each teammate, biweekly.
- Team Leads lead a weekly team feedback meeting, with engineers and Product Managers as stakeholders (PMs lead when TL is out).
	- Do we want to adjust any processes?
	- Are there any team-wide issues?
	- Discuss any personnel changes.
- All decisions ([ADRs](adrs.md), etc.) are documented in a single, searchable location.
