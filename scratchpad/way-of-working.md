# My "Way of Working"
_aka my post-ceremonial-agile processes_

## Board practices

- **All** work is be visualized on the board. There is no such thing as work "outside the scope of the iteration/project/team".
- Columns reflect the workflow.
	- [Todo/Doing/Done is not your process](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-2.html).
	- [Blocked is not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices.html).
	- [Done is not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-3.html).
- [Use WIP limits](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-5.html).
- [Use colors, wisely](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-4.html).

## Daily re-planning huddles

- Daily huddles are re-planning meetings, not status meetings.
- Led by Team Leads or Product Managers.
- [Work the board from right to left](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/03/comments-on-board-practices-7.html). What work we can ship today?
- [Focus on the work, not the workers](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-6.html).
- Record *all* decisions (using [ADRs](adrs.md), etc.)

## Product/iteration planning meetings

- Iterative product evolution: :ice_skate: :arrow_right: :kick_scooter: :arrow_right: :bike: :arrow_right: :motorcycle: :arrow_right: :car:
- Prioritization, not estimation. The best estimates are still only bets.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines. How much time are we willing to spend/risk?
- Record *all* decisions (using [ADRs](adrs.md), etc.)

## Other meetings

- Team Leads have 1:1s with each teammate, biweekly.
- Team Leads lead a weekly team feedback meeting, with engineers and Product Managers as stakeholders (PMs lead when TL is out).
	- Do we want to adjust any processes?
	- Are there any team-wide issues?
	- Discuss any personnel changes.
- formal product planning happens monthly  
- ad-hoc product replanning is welcome, but must be documented and reviewed at next formal planning meeting  
- all decisions are documented in a single, searchable location
