# Mob Programming

## Rhythm

Appoint or otherwise decide-upon a [Facilitator](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns). At the start of the mob session, and then at every swap, the Facilitator reminds the group to do the following:

1. Define a "swap timer" length. Start with 20m (ala Pomodoro) if you need help choosing. You can adjust it later.
2. Define/swap [roles](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns). Swapping isn't *required* every time, but swapping often is _strongly encouraged_.
