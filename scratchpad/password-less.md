# Password-less Web Apps
For web applications, we have a nice secure(-ish) local container now in all greenfield browsers. A basic no-password strategy looks something like:

1. First use _is_ registration. Store a unique token for this account + device + browser trio, encrypted in a cookie or localstorage.  
2. In the app's account settings, provide an "Add a Device/Browser to This Account" [capability URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/), which folks may copy/email/text to themselves. **For security: Generate this capability URL on-demand, and make it expire immediately upon use.**
3. Upon visiting the capability URL from step #2, via any browser on any device, all registered devices/browsers are notified, and asked to confirm the new device/browser. The capability URL should expire immediately, whether or not confirmation is successful.
4. Upon confirmation from an registered device/browser, the new device + browser is added to the account, and step #1 is repeated for that new browser.

Voila, you now have a password-less, device-authed system. Implementation details such as notifications (browser? email? other?) are left to the reader. This is a gross oversimplification of what Signal, Keybase, WhatsApp, and others are already doing.

They're also exploring how social media might be used to help solve  social problems like disinformation & extremism, instead of exacerbating them.
And how we repair it

We're not *presently* using this specific technique (we'll be reintroducing it though). However, we are using capability-based authorization, which is arguably even cooler.
