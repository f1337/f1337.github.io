# Practice Groups

## Attributes

- A volunteer, [cooperative effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) to align and share specialized expertise.
- Persistent by nature, and design.
- Cross-team, but discipline-specific.
- Not guilds. The word guild is overloaded with ancient connotations. Also we're not cargo-culting.
- Practice groups may do the work to accomplish a goal themselves (as time/commitments permit), and/or propose projects to leadership for prioritization.

## Example practices

- Security
- Ruby/Rails
- HTTP APIs
- React
- 508
