# Practice Groups

Something like the "elected civil servants" who govern the work. Blah blah.

## Features

- A volunteer, [cooperative effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) to establish & maintain professional standards & expertise.
- Persistent by nature, and design.
- Cross-team, but discipline-specific.
- Propose projects, to leadership for prioritization.

## Anti-Features

- Not guilds, or channels, or any other Spotify terms. Their jargon is overloaded with connotations that contradict the intended pattern. Plus copying [Spotify](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify) isn't agile, it's [cargo-culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult). Spotify's "model" works for them because, bear with me, it's _modeled_ after Spotify's unique organizational needs.

## Example practices

- Security
- Ruby/Rails
- HTTP APIs
