# Co-ops

> [One] theory of organization is what we might call the theory of spontaneous order: that given a common need, a collection of people will, by trial and error, by improvisation and experiment, evolve order out of chaos — this order being more durable and more closely related to their needs than any kind of externally imposed order.

— [Anarchism as a Theory of Organization](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/colin-ward-anarchism-as-a-theory-of-organization), Colin Ward, 1966.


## Features

- A volunteer, [cooperative effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) to accomplish a specific goal.
- Ephemeral by nature, and design. Some may be long-lasting, some may be very short lived.
- Cross-team, cross-functional, and cross-disciplinary. Anyone is welcome, this is definitely not just for engineers.
- Co-ops may do the work to accomplish a goal themselves (as time/commitments permit), and/or propose projects to leadership for prioritization.

## Anti-Features

- Not hierarchical. At LendingHome, it took less than two months for the "architecture guild" to be hijacked and turned into a defacto "architecture review board". And not for healthy reasons.
- Not guilds. The word guild is overloaded with ancient connotations. Plus copying [Spotify](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify) isn't agile, it's [cargo-culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult). Spotify's "model" works for them because, bear with me, it's _modeled_ after Spotify's unique organizational needs.

## Example goals

- Improve signal-to-noise ratios of our alerting.
