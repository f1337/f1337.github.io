# Co-ops

## Attributes

- A volunteer, [cooperative effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) to accomplish a specific goal.
- Ephemeral by nature, and design. Some may be long-lasting, some may be very short lived.
- Cross-team, cross-functional, and cross-disciplinary. Anyone is welcome, this is definitely not just for engineers.
- Not guilds. The word guild is overloaded with ancient connotations. Also we're not cargo-culting.
- Co-ops may do the work to accomplish a goal themselves (as time/commitments permit), and/or propose projects to leadership for prioritization.

## Example goals

- Improve signal-to-noise ratios of our alerting.
