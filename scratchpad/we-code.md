i want a twitch-like experience, without verbal interruption from the peanut gallery.

chat comments are easier to ignore, and therefore less disruptive to me.

i am internally "talking to myself" when i code, so i find verbal interruptions to be extra disruptive as they break my internal dialogue.

what are your thoughts/experiences w/ the hangouts you've been doing? can we set expectations and/or define a culture for this?

FWIW, i *like* verbal feedback during mobbing sessions, even from the peanut gallery. but i don't like it for those times when i'm not really trying to pair, i'm just trying to share.
