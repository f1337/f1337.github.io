_I was in a band during the late 1990s and early 2000s. We made some recordings, toured the lower 48 U.S., started to chart AAA & college radio, had albums in Tower Recordsâ€¦ and then our distributor went bankrupt (they were embezzling), which caused the label to go bankrupt, and eventually the band fell apart from the disappoint._
