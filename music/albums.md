# albums

_I was in an indie rock band during the 1990s. We made some recordings, toured the continental U.S., charted AAA & college radio, had albums in Tower Recordsâ€¦ and then our distributor went bankrupt (they were embezzling), which caused the label to go bankrupt, and eventually the band disbanded from the disappointment._
