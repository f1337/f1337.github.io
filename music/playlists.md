# playlists

In my teens, and early 20s, I would make mixtapes for friends. I fell out of the habit when I went digital with music, and my friends were still using tape. Early mp3s sounded like garbage when transfeered to tape. I've recently started making playlists, to satisfy a similar creative desire. Unless otherwise stated, I loosely apply the constraint: "the song is in my library, or it should be". Without further adoâ€¦



- [All](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/all/pl.u-ydNAu9BZJb). Prompt: Songs with "all" in their titles. WIP: the order doesn't flow the way i want it to.
- [Chugga Chugga](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/chugga-chugga/pl.u-Xa60iRBgxX). Prompt: Songs whose rhythm section reminds me of a steam locomotive.
- [Xzibit x DMX](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/xzibit-x-dmx/pl.u-z0RPCkp8vG). Prompt: The letter X.
