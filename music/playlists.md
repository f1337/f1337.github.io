# playlists

In my teens, and early 20s, I would make mixtapes for friends. I fell out of the habit when I went digital with music, and my friends were still using tape. Early mp3s sounded like garbage when transfeered to tape. I've recently started making playlists, to satisfy a similar creative desire. Unless otherwise stated, I loosely apply the constraint: "the song is in my library, or if it is not already there, it should be". Without further adoâ€¦
