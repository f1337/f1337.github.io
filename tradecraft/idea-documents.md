# Idea Documents

## What are they?

A short structured document to help determine how useful and achievable an idea is.

## When might we write an Idea Document?

Any time we have an idea for a feature/improvement/bugfix/whatever which requires research, may impact others on our team, or impact other teams, or if we just want feedback.

If we find ourselves wondering if we should write an RFC, an Idea Document is lower-effort, and its format naturally evolves into an RFC (if needed/desired).

## Why would we write an idea document?

- To determine the viability of an idea.
- To solicit feedback early in the problem-solving process.
- To communicate impact and/or importance to others.

## Who may write an Idea Document?

Anyone! Idea Documents are intended to be used by everyone, including product managers, engineers, designers, end-users, writersâ€¦literally any member of the organization may write one.
