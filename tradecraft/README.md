- Team Leads have 1:1s with each teammate, biweekly.
- Team Leads lead a weekly team feedback meeting, with engineers and Product Managers as stakeholders (PMs lead when TL is out).
	- Do we want to adjust any processes?
	- Are there any team-wide issues?
	- Discuss any personnel changes.

## Et cetera
