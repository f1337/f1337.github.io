_Techniques & processes for software development, synthesized while standing upon the shoulders of giants._

## Techniques

- [Board practices](board-practices.md)
- [Daily huddles](daily-huddles.md)
- [Planning meetings](planning-meetings.md)
- [Team meetings](team-meetings.md)

## Collaboration tools 

- All decisions ([ADRs](architectural-decision-records.md), etc.) are documented in a single, searchable location.
- [Architectural decision records](tradecraft/architectural-decision-records.md) and [when to use them](tradecraft/flowchart.md).
- Use [idea documents](idea-documents.md) to vet ideas.
- Use [mob programming](mob-programming.md) to unblock, to push through hard problems, and to share knowledge.
