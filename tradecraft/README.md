_Techniques & processes for software development, synthesized while standing upon the shoulders of giants._

- [Board Practices](board-practices.md)
- [Daily Huddles](daily-huddles)
- 

## Daily re-planning huddles

- Use daily huddles for re-planning meetings, not status meetings.
- Led by Team Leads or Product Managers.
- [Work the board from right to left](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/03/comments-on-board-practices-7.html). What work we can ship today?
- [Focus on the work, not the workers](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-6.html).
- Ad-hoc product re-planning is welcome, but should be documented and reviewed at next formal planning meeting. Record and publish *all* changes for stakeholder review.

## Product/iteration planning meetings

- Monthly formal product/iteration planning, to adjust priorities and workstreams. This is where big goalpost moves can happen.
- Review past month's decisions from re-planning meetings (if any, include ADRs).
- Prioritization, not estimation. The best estimates are still only bets.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines. How much time are we willing to spend/risk?
- Record *all* decisions.
- Iterative product evolution :ice_skate: :arrow_right: :kick_scooter: :arrow_right: :bike: :arrow_right: :motorcycle: :arrow_right: :car:

## Meetings

- Retros: [Turn up the good](turn-up-the-good.md), turn down the criticism.
- Team Leads have 1:1s with each teammate, biweekly.
- Team Leads lead a weekly team feedback meeting, with engineers and Product Managers as stakeholders (PMs lead when TL is out).
	- Do we want to adjust any processes?
	- Are there any team-wide issues?
	- Discuss any personnel changes.

## Et cetera 

- All decisions ([ADRs](architectural-decision-records.md), etc.) are documented in a single, searchable location.
- [Architectural decision records](tradecraft/architectural-decision-records.md) and [when to use them](tradecraft/flowchart.md).
- Use [idea documents](idea-documents.md) to vet ideas.
- Use [mob programming](mob-programming.md) to unblock, to push through hard problems, and to share knowledge.
