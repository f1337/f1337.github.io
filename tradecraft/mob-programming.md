# Mob Programming

## What is Mob Programming?

> The basic concept of mob programming is simple: the entire team works as a team together on one task at the time. That is: one team – one (active) keyboard – one screen.

## FAQs

### When do we mob?

When we think the cost for mobbing will be less than the cost of working siloed. Sometimes working in individual threads is better: more efficient, better for morale/mental-health, etc. When individual work thread become blocked, or stuck in a miscommunication loop, often a short pairing or mobbing session is the solution.

### How does mobbing differ from a hackathon?

### Is mobbing like pairing with more people?

Yes, but it also a bit more structured. It is easier for two people to find a social equilibrium that works for them than it is for 3-4+. The additional structure 


## How do we mob?

Appoint or otherwise decide-upon a [Facilitator](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns). At the start of the mob session, and then at every swap, the Facilitator reminds the group to do the following:

1. Define the desired swapping interval (~20-30m), then [start the timer](https://pomofocus.io/).
2. Define/document/update the [Punch List](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns).
3. Define/swap [roles](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns). Everyone isn't _required_ to swap roles every time, but swapping roles often is _strongly encouraged_.

	- Navigator
	- Driver
	- Researcher (optional)
4. Work the problem until a break, natural or forced, is needed.
5. Appoint/elect a new Facilitator, then repeat steps 1-5.
