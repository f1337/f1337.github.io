# Mob Programming

> The basic concept of mob programming is simple: the entire team works as a team together on one task at the time. That is: one team – one (active) keyboard – one screen (projector of course). [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming#cite_note-2)

## Rhythm

Appoint or otherwise decide-upon a [Facilitator](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns). At the start of the mob session, and then at every swap, the Facilitator reminds the group to do the following:

1. Define a "swap timer" length, then start the timer. Start with 20m (ala Pomodoro) if you need help choosing. You can adjust it later.
2. Define/document/update the [Punch List](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns).
3. Define/swap [roles](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/mob-programming-patterns#patterns). Everyone isn't _required_ to swap roles every time, but swapping roles often is _strongly encouraged_.
	- Recorder
	- Navigator
	- Driver
	- Researcher (optional)
4. Work the problem until a break, natural or forced, is needed.
5. Appoint/elect a new Facilitator, then repeat steps 1-5.
