# Thought Larder

_Techniques & processes for software development, synthesized while standing upon the shoulders of giants._

## Processes

- [Board practices](board-practices.md)
- [Daily huddles](daily-huddles.md)
- [Planning meetings](planning-meetings.md)
- [Team meetings](team-meetings.md)
- [Interview questions](tech-programming-interview-questions.md)

## Techniques 

- Document decisions ([ADRs](architectural-decision-records.md), [etc.](flowchart.md)) in one accessible, searchable location.
- Use [idea documents](idea-documents.md) to share & vet ideas.
- Use [mob programming](mob-programming.md) to unblock, to push through hard problems, and to share knowledge.
- Whether one is [refactoring](https://www.geepawhill.org/2019/03/03/refactoring-pro-tip-easiest-nearest-owwie-first/), or troubleshooting, [ENOF](https://twitter.com/GeePawHill/status/1305157815854657536?s=20) is often enough: solve the Easiest Nearest Owwie First. Many thanks to [@GeePawHill](https://twitter.com/GeePawHill) for coining this improvement to "Low Hanging Fruit".
