# Daily re-planning huddles

- Use daily huddles for realigning, ala [dead reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning), not for status. 
- [Walking the board from right to left](https://www.zmarcusoft.net/2017/03/comments-on-board-practices-7.html), ask: What work we can ship today?
- [Focus on the work, not the workers](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-6.html).
- Ad-hoc product re-planning is welcome, but should be documented, and reviewed, at the next formal planning meeting. Record and publish *all* priority changes for stakeholder review.
- Q: How is this different from a Scrum "standup"? A: It expressly rejects any inherited expectations, definitions, or connotations, related to Scrum stand-ups.
