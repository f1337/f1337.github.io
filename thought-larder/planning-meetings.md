# Product/iteration planning meetings

- Monthly formal product/iteration planning, to adjust priorities and workstreams. This is where big goalpost moves can happen.
- Review past month's decisions from re-planning meetings (if any, include ADRs).
- Prioritization, not estimation. The best estimates are still only bets.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines. How much time are we willing to spend/risk?
- Record *all* decisions.
