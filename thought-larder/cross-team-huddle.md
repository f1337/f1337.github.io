## Workstream Review (5m)

For each workstream, identify whether it is **On** track, **Off** track, **On Hold**, **Blocked**, or **Done**. *Resist the temptation for commentary:* none is necessary, there is no judgement.

### Status Legend

**On track**: _proceeding_ as expected; “expected” is not necessarily “fast”.  
**Off track**: _proceeding_, but not as expected; at risk of not meeting our goals. Equivalent to “at risk”.

**On Hold**: _not proceeding_, as expected; some decision has been made to prioritize other work, etc.  
**Blocked**: _not proceeding_, and not expected, due to circumstances outside our direct control.

**Done**: As done as it is going to be, maintenance & bug fixes not included. Any new work will likely be a new initiative/effort.

| Workstream   | Prior Status | Current Status |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Workstream 1 | On           | On             |
| Workstream 2 | Done?        | Done!          |
| Workstream 3 | Off          | Blocked        |
| Workstream 4 | On Hold      | On             |
| Workstream 5 | On           | Done!          |

### Missing Workstreams

Are there any workstreams that should be in progress, per the roadmap, but are not listed above? If so, we should add them, then mark them as Off track.
