# Cross-Team Huddle

## Workstream Review (5m)

For each workstream, identify whether it is **On** track, **Off** track, **On Hold**, **Blocked**, or **Done**. *Resist the temptation for commentary:* none is necessary, there is no judgement.

### Status Legend

**On track**: _proceeding_ as expected; “expected” is not necessarily “fast”.  
**Off track**: _proceeding_, but not as expected; at risk of not meeting our goals. Equivalent to “at risk”.

**On Hold**: _not proceeding_, as expected; some decision has been made to prioritize other work, etc.  
**Blocked**: _not proceeding_, and not expected, due to circumstances outside our direct control.

**Done**: As done as it is going to be, maintenance & bug fixes not included. Any new work will likely be a new initiative/effort.
