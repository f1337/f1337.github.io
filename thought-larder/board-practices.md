# Board practices

- **All** work is visualized on the board. There is no such thing as work "outside the scope of the iteration/project/team".
- [Todo/Doing/Done is not your process](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-2.html). The columns on the board should reflect your _actual_ workflow. One way to find your process is to work backwards from "done", asking _"[What happens before that?](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-2.html#how-to-do-this)"_.
- _Blocked_ should be a label, [not a column]
- (https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices.html).
- [Done is not a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-3.html), because merging/deployment isn't the end of our work. Use _Monitor in Production_, _Collect Metrics_, _Gather Release Feedback_, or some other term that reflects our actual post-launch processes instead.
- [Use WIP limits](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-5.html).

	- [Kanban Flow Simulator](https://mgajdzik.com/kanban-flow-simulator/)
- [Use colors, wisely](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-4.html).
