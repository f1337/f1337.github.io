## My "Way of Working"

_aka my post-ceremonial-agile processes_

- **All** work is shown on the board.
- Daily huddles are re-planning meetings, not status meetings.
- Prioritization, not estimation.
- Time-boxed effort, not deadlines.
- Record *all* decisions (using ADRs, etc.)
- Iterative product evolution :skateboard: :arrow_right: :kick_scooter: :arrow_right: :bike: :arrow_right: :motorcycle: :arrow_right: :car:
